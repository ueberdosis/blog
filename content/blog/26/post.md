To be honest, we had a rough start in 2021. The landlord discontinued our office rental agreement as of June. Covid-19 blues have delayed the beginning of new projects. Therefore, we had to touch our financial savings for the first time. And the prolongation of the second lockdown in Germany had an extra emotional strain on many of us.

But! Fortunately, we are back on track. We will move to our new office in April. It's just one floor above, and it still looks the same but has a small roof terrace. And even the delayed projects are running again.

## ðŸ˜­ If that wasnâ€™t enough, there is another sad news.

Carin, our first employee at Ã¼berdosis, has left us in February to pursue her passion as a foreign language correspondent. Since 2015, the very beginning of Ã¼berdosis, Carin has been our Swiss Army Knife in Office Management. She developed a hell of a lot of processes with us, many of them are the backbone of our success today.

Carin, you are and always will be in our hearts as our first employee. You started this crazy journey of Ã¼berdosis with us, and it was more than a pleasure to have had you on board. We are so thankful for everything you have done for us, your trust, your loyalty, your honesty, and very especially your patience with us.

There are moments when thereâ€™s simply nothing to sugarcoat, and this is one of them. Itâ€™s time to say goodbye. From the bottom of our hearts, we wish you all the best, stay well, and stay as you are.
