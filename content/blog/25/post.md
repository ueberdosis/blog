## Folks, we have a problem.

Pandemic-driven home office and COVID-19 blues are a massive dealbreaker for face-to-face socializing between employees, reducing their contacts. As a small office, we established a digital get-together every month besides our weekly jour fixe to keep the personal touch.

We played some funny but messy browser games in April 2020 during one of those sessions when someone asked for a battleship game. And guess what? We didn't find one for more than two players. 

Our designer Nick created a rough draft of the coordinate system, sent it as a PDF to the team, and shared his Figma screen as the host of a quick and dirty battleship game. This was epic fun with such a simple solution! 

Some online socializing sessions later, we got surprised by a lovely designed Figma prototype, a typical move of our dear mate Nick, who always runs the extra mile as fast as he can, but five times.

## Someone has to build this.

This! Was! Impressive! Someone has to build it as a real browser game. We didn't even finish the sentence when four people already raised their hands and offered. It was one of those euphoric seconds when you feel the infinite momentum of this team.

## Let's create a browser game.

Pumped with the sweet juice of dopamine and sparkling eyes like little children cuddling with a puppy dog, we started a Battleship-hackathon. But we quickly realized that there were still missing a ton of designs and product decisions if we wanted to nail it. We decided to choose a product owner, shift the project to our primary working time as an intern product, putting one designer and two web developers nearly full-time onto, and define a timeline for the first version, including a landing page.

We outbid each other with all kinds of ideas in our Scrum board until we decided to do a feature freeze to have the first version anyway. Needed extra time for product improvements to become an überdosis version of Battleship: + two weeks.
## What the hell have we done?

Six weeks later, we played Battleship in the browser for the first time with nine people, which felt overwhelming. Absolutely, we did it! Six wonderful weeks from a silly idea to a lovely product. Or, as one of the web developers said: "Weird, doesn't feel like work, feels more like coding with a friend on a fun project in my free time."

Battleship seems like a game created by a team who radically focused on the people who play it – in this case, themselves.

## LOL, those crazy weirdos.

Honestly, we invested a few hundred hours in this game, paid on our own. You don't make those decisions when you own an MBA. But was it worth every penny? It was! And would we do this again? We promise!

It was team building par excellence, plus we had so much fun developing this game. Work isn't about making money with every decision you take. It's about executing your passion, which confidently results in cash.
